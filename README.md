# My tilde, my dotti, the muse of my creation

These dotfiles are highly oppinionated and shamelessly copied from others and eventually
adjusted to my needs and foremost to my taste.

## Installation

To install/update, make sure ansible is installed and then run the `main.yml`
playbook:

 `ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts ansible/main.yml`
