# My tilde, my dotti, the muse of my creation

These dotfiles are highly oppinionated and shamelessly copied from others and eventually
adjusted to my needs and foremost to my taste.

Feel free to use them, use parts of it or... whateever, see `COPYING`. But use at your own risk!

## Installation

To install, execute `git clone https://github.com/mrolli/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap`
