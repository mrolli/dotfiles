# My tilde, my dotti, the muse of my creation

These dotfiles are highly opinionated and shamelessly copied from others and eventually
adjusted to my needs and foremost to my taste.

## Installation

To install/update, make sure ansible is installed and then run the `main.yml`
playbook:

 `ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts ansible/main.yml`

This playbook in principle manages `~/.config` and adds symlinks for each
object in the directory `config/` there or to `~/`. It's possible to add object
to the list `dotfiles_omit_configs` to have them skipped when creating symlinks.
See `ansible/main.yml` for the details.
